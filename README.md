# A-Network-analysis-of-Game-of-Thrones
This was a DataCamp project. In this project, we will look at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). We will look at how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.
